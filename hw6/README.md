# üéØ Assignment Goal

The primary goal is to build, train, and evaluate a classification model on the CIFAR-10 dataset using two different deep learning frameworks chosen from TensorFlow, PyTorch, or MindSpore.

# üìä Dataset Overview
The task uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which has the following characteristics:Images: 60,000 color images (RGB, 3-channel).Classes: 10 distinct classes, with 6,000 images per class.Image Size: $32 \times 32$ pixels.Splits: 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.Complexity: Contains real-world objects, making it more challenging due to noise and variations in object scale and features compared to the MNIST dataset.

# ‚úÖ Core Requirements

## Framework Implementation: 

- Implement a classification model using **two** of the following deep learning frameworks: TensorFlow(Google), PyTorch(Meta), or MindSpore(Huawei).
- Performance Standard: The classification model built must achieve a classification accuracy of **at least 80%** on the test set for each framework.
- Model Structure: The model structure can be the same or different across the two chosen frameworks.

## üìù Required Deliverables (in the Report)

The final report (PDF format) must include at least the following four items for each of the two frameworks used:
- Model Explanation: A description of the deep learning model architecture used.
- Loss Curves: Plots of the loss curves over training for both the training set and the test set.- Accuracy Curve: A plot of the accuracy curve over training for the test set.
- Framework Comparison: A comparative analysis of the two frameworks, covering performance metrics, time efficiency, and development difficulty.
- Performance Metrics: Measured by the average loss and accuracy on the test set.
- Time Efficiency: Measured using the Linux time function or calculated internally within the Python program.
